# ðŸ’³ Console Banking System (Java)

A simple console-based banking system built in Java that allows users to create and manage bank accounts with secure login functionality. Developed by a team of five as part of a software engineering course project, this system includes support for basic banking operations such as deposit, withdrawal, and fund transfer, along with account detail management.

ðŸš§ A GUI version is currently in development, and we're in the process of transitioning from an Excel-based database to MySQL.
